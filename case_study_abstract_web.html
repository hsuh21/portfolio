            <p>As a coding novice, learning to position is an essential skill. This project served as a flexbox and media queries exercise, allowing me to create responsive websites. I used the <a href="https://www.trixiecosmetics.com/">Trixie Cosmetics</a> website as my reference for my divs.</p>
            <img src="images/abstract_web_figma1.JPG">
            <p>I imported a screenshot of the webpage into Figma where I could begin drafting my design. On another layer, I drew boxes over the divs. This allowed me visualize where I needed parent containers and how many children were in each.</p>

            <img src="images/abstract_web_small.JPG">
            <p>The second challenge was creating a responsive webpage that could be viewed at mobile screen size. Flexbox could manage smaller viewport changes, but for different screens I used media queries. Once the viewport width was below a certain size, I decreased the amount of divs per row and their size. This can be seen in the above comparison between the desktop and mobile versions.</p>
