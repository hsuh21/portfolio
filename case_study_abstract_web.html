            <div id="top">As a coding novice, learning to position is an essential skill. This project served as a flexbox and media queries exercise, allowing me to create responsive websites. I used the Trixie Cosmetics website as my reference for my divs.</div>

            <p>This allowed me to design my website without worrying about the logistics. Afterwards, I used the properties and suggested css to guide my coding. It helped me discover new properties like border-radius to create a frame for my profile picture.</p>

            <p>I was easily able to find the div sizes and color hexes I needed from Figma. From this project onwards, this site became an important tool for translating my designs to code.</p>
