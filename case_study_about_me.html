            <div id="top">For this project, I wanted to create a website to introduce myself and provide my contacts. I began planning my webpage using Figma.</div>
            <img id="figma1" src="images/about_me_figma1.JPG">
            <p>This allowed me to design my website without worrying about the logistics. Afterwards, I used the properties and suggested css to guide my coding. It helped me discover new properties like border-radius to create a frame for my profile picture.</p>
            <img src="images/about_me_figma2.JPG">
            <p>I was easily able to find the div sizes and color hexes I needed from Figma. From this project onwards, this site became an important tool for translating my designs to code.</p>
